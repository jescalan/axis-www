    h1#installation Installation
    :marked
      You can and should install axis through [npm](http://npmjs.org), which comes bundled with [node.js](http://nodejs.org). You can install axis into a node project with the following command:

      ```
      npm install axis --save
      ```

      Please also note that since axis is built on top of nib, all of nib's functionality is also available. Check out [nib's docs](http://nibstyl.us/docs/) for even more goodness. Finally, you can find the full source for axis [on github, here](https://github.com/jenius/axis).

    h1#usage Usage
    :marked
      Axis comes as a very standard stylus plugin, but unfortunately there are a huge variety of ways that you can use stylus plugins and it would be impossible to cover them all here. But I will try to cover as many of the common use cases as possible.

      Before we start with the different build system integrations though, I want to note the single option that you can initialize axis with. By default, axis will auto-import itself into all your stylesheets. This is purely for convenience -- axis only defines mixins, so it's invisible if you don't use any of it's mixins anyway. However, if you'd rather not have it do this, you can initialize axis with `{ implicit: false }`, then you'll need to manually `@import` it in your stylus in order to use it. Ok, on to integrations.

    h4 Standalone

    :marked
      Using axis with a straight up stylus pipeline is fairly simple with the [use function](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/js.html#usefn). The code below demonstrates a simple use case.

      ```js
      var stylus = require('stylus'),
          axis = require('axis'),
          fs = require('fs');

      var code = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file.styl', 'utf8');

      stylus(code)
        .use(axis())
        .render(console.log.bind(console));
      ```

    h4 Accord &amp; Roots

    :marked
      [Accord](https://github.com/jenius/accord) is a clean and uniform interface to a large number of compiled languages. It's used behind the scenes of a number of libraries, including the wonderful static site build tool [roots](http://roots.cx). It's stylus adapter is [fully documented](https://github.com/jenius/accord/blob/master/docs/stylus.md), and includes ['use'](https://github.com/jenius/accord/blob/master/docs/stylus.md#use) similar to the direct stylus API. Here's an example of how it would look loading in axis.

      ```js
      var accord = require('accord'),
          axis = require('axis'),
          fs = require('fs');

      var styl = accord.load('stylus');
      var code = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/file.styl', 'utf8');

      styl.render(code, { use: axis() })
        .then(console.log.bind(console))
      ```

      If you are using Roots, you can just load axis in as a stylus plugin in the `app.coffee` file as such:

      ```coffee
      axis = require 'axis'

      module.exports =
        stylus: { use: axis() }
      ```

    h4 Gulp

    :marked
      You can use accord directly with gulp if you'd like through the [gulp-accord](https://github.com/carrot/gulp-accord) plugin, which can compile any of the languages accord supports, or use the [gulp-stylus](https://github.com/stevelacy/gulp-stylus) plugin, which also uses accord under the hood. Here's how it would look with gulp-stylus:

      ```js
      var gulp = require('gulp'),
          stylus = require('gulp-stylus'),
          axis = require('axis');

      gulp.task('default', function(){
        gulp.src('./path/to/file.styl')
        .pipe(stylus({ use: axis() }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./destination/folder'));
      });
      ```

    h4 Grunt

    :marked
      Although grunt's stylus plugin doesn't use accord, it takes very similar options, and will look almost the same, although a lot more verbose than gulp, but that's just how grunt is. Here's how a snippet of the config would look in use:

      ```js
      var axis = require('axis');

      stylus: {
        compile: {
          options: { use: axis() },
          files: { '/path/to/result.css': '/path/to/file.styl' }
        }
      }
      ```

    h4 Express

    :marked
      Stylus actually has [very nice documentation on its own site](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/middleware.html) on how to use it with express, so follow this to get stylus set up. Beyond that, just `use` axis in the pipeline as is described in the standalone section above. Example of this in action:

      ```js
      var express = require('express'),
          axis = require('axis');

      var app = express()

      app.middleware({
        src: __dirname,
        dest: __dirname  '/public',
        compile: compile
      });

      function compile(str, path){
        return stylus(str)
          .set('filename', path)
          .use(axis());
      }
      ```
